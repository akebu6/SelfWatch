## What it does

## 🎨 Design

## 🛠 How we Built it
- React
- Auth0 2.0

## ✨ Proud Achievements
We are proud of successfully developing a comprehensive mental health monitoring and support system. We were able to implement accurate mood tracking algorithms and provide personalised insights to users. 

## 😤 Challenges Encountered
Some of the changes that the team faced are:
- Working with Auth0 for the first time. It proved quite challenging to work with Auth0 2.0
- 

## 🙌 Insights from SelfWatch
As our team consisted of members with different abilities, we were able to fill in gaps in our knowledge and learn something new from each other in React and other technologies. There were also new things that we had to research and self learn like React-routers.

## 🚀 What's next for SelfWatch
The next thing for SelfWatch is adding more features such as being able to track the user's sleep habits and supplements that they take.
