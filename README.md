# SelfWatch
Empowering individuals to take control of their mental health by providing a personal monitoring and support system.

## 💡 Inspiration
The increasing prevalence of mental health issues and the lack of accessible and personalised support motivated us to undertake this project. We wanted to create a tool that would empower individuals to monitor their mental health and provide them with resources and support when needed.

## 🤔 Purpose
SelfWatch was designed to help people practice self-care more by providing with trackers and reminders when they haven't checked-in for the day.

## What it does
SelfWatch is a web application that allows users to track their mental health and well-being on a daily basis. Users can input their mood, energy levels, sleep quality, and other relevant factors, and the app will generate personalised insights and recommendations based on the data. Users can set goals and receive reminders to engage in self-care activities. 

## 🎨 Design
SelfWatch was first designd using Figma before it was coded. Below are the wireframes and designs that the team used. However. some things were changed so the app does not look exactly like the designs shown.

## 🛠 How we Built it
- React
- Auth0 2.0
- Vite
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB

## ✨ Proud Achievements
We are proud of successfully developing a comprehensive mental health monitoring and support system. We were able to implement accurate mood tracking algorithms and provide personalised insights to users. 

## 😤 Challenges Encountered
Some of the changes that the team faced are:
- Working with Auth0 for the first time. It proved quite challenging to work with Auth0 2.0
- 

## 🙌 Insights from SelfWatch
As our team consisted of members with different abilities, we were able to fill in gaps in our knowledge and learn something new from each other in React and other technologies. There were also new things that we had to research and self learn like React-routers.

## 🚀 What's next for SelfWatch
The next thing for SelfWatch is adding more features such as being able to track the user's sleep habits and supplements that they take.
